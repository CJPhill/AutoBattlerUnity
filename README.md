# AutoBattlerUnity

This is a project to make a game that is similar to Riot's Teamfight Tactics. The end goal will be a single player Auto battler (Game where you put characters on a board like chess but then they fight by themselves) 
that will revolve around the concept of creating a leader and making a party that helps your leader. For more current information on what is pitched please look at the Pitch.pdf
